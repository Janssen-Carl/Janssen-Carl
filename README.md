## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Janssen-Carl, an IT student with a focus on exploring new technologies, improving system performance, and diving into various aspects of programming. My experiences span across multiple areas of IT, from solving complex computational problems to maintaining efficient hardware setups.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - **Optimizing system performance** on Linux environments, including resolving issues with resource management and enhancing device responsiveness.
  - **Algorithm development** and challenges in Java and C++ aimed at improving computational logic and problem-solving efficiency.
  - **Mobile phone troubleshooting**, with a focus on addressing lag and overheating.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - **Java/C++ fundamentals**, such as Object Oriented Programming and data structures.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - **System optimization projects** for both desktop and mobile devices.
  - Projects focused on **algorithm development** and improving code efficiency in Java and C++.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
  - Enhancing **system performance on low-spec devices**, especially troubleshooting persistent issues like unresponsiveness.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - **Linux Operating Systems and Java and C++ programming tips**, especially related to core concepts like object-oriented design **
